# gardening-system
a basic gardening system that helps garderners plan out their next meal or which activities to pursue today based on what they did in the past; if they are using it for the first time they are asked to make an account, and then set up their interests, and then plan out or look through existing lists and categories that show a variety of plant-based inforamation on what they should grow next. another effort on the part of the application is to track daily carbon useage and help the users to lower their usage by making them log their entries on what they did today and their carbon output is shown, along with recommendations. this is basically a nature application that has a gardening and carbon usage feature, and more might be added due to the wider availability of sensors that can meaure plant growth, quality, etc. I might apply this to work for agriculture efforts in maintaining consistent plant growth
